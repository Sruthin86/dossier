            <p>
                I led the development of MakeAtState, an open-source software application built with PHP to streamline the submission and management of fabrication projects. Designed specifically for makerspaces, the application supports a wide range of fabrication services including 3D printing, laser cutting, and CNC routing.
            </p>
            <p>
                MakeAtState allows users to upload project files, specify job details, and communicate directly with makerspace staff. On the administrative side, staff can manage incoming submissions, download files, provide pricing and delivery estimates, and notify users when their projects are ready for pickup. A built-in messaging feature facilitates seamless communication between users and staff throughout the project lifecycle.
            </p>
            <p>
                The application is freely available on GitHub under the Apache license, making it accessible for other institutions or makerspaces looking to implement a similar solution.

            <strong>Abstract:</strong>
            <p>
                This paper provides a case study on how consistent UX testing can improve the digital experience for library patrons. Every month for the last year, we planned and carried out various UX testing on the [...] Library website. Our research included a comparative analysis of other library websites and user testing of our own library website. The comparative analysis granted us insight about the services featured on other library websites, and the information architecture of those sites. From our own testing, we discovered areas of our site that serve our users well, and other areas where there are pain points. This testing allowed us to come up with tangible solutions we were able to apply to our website.
