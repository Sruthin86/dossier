            <h2>ALA Core Web Committee</h2>
            <p>
                I joined the ALA core web committe in Fall 2024. Joining the ALA Core web committee was an incredibly welcoming experience. It was nice to see friendly faces that I know from the MSU Library and from past ALA Core conferences. I felt a strong sense of camaraderie and support. The committee members were eager to learn about my background and how my Drupal technical expertise could benefit their website.
            </p>
            <p>
                During our initial meetings, I was encouraged to share my ideas and suggestions, and they were eager to listen to my experience migrating from Drupal 7 to Drupal 10. The ALA core team were open to exploring new approaches to enhance the website's functionality and user experience. This collaborative environment allowed me to quickly gain an understanding of their needs and jump right into action.
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked closely with other committee members who trained me on using their Drupal setup and my technical skills in Drupal were leveraged to clean up the Awards and Scholarships page (<a href="https://www.ala.org/core/awards-scholarships/margaret-mann-citationq">https://www.ala.org/core/awards-scholarships/margaret-mann-citation</a>). I was also able to lend my experience to fix some of the Accessibility issues on this page.
            </p>

                Overall, my experience with the ALA Core web committee was both rewarding and fulfilling, and Iâ€™m already on the list to serve as a co-chair next year
