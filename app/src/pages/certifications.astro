        <h2>Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies (CPACC)</h2>
        <p> 
            In Summer 2023, I began preparing for the Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies (CPACC)exam as part of my 2023â€“2024 professional development goals. My preparation started by joining CPACC prep group that was moderated by Kevin Henley, which included a 10-week prep course and a weekly meeting with the cohort. I also enrolled in structured, self-paced lessons through Deque University, which provided a strong foundation in accessibility principles, standards, and best practices.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the exam approached, I intensified my study efforts throughout April 2024, focusing on the core domains of accessibility knowledge: disabilities and assistive technologies, accessibility and universal design, and relevant laws and standards such as WCAG and ADA.
        </p>
        <p> 
            On June 2, 2024, I was officially awarded the CPACC certification (Figure 1). Earning this credential was a significant milestone in my accessibility journey. It not only strengthened my knowledge and commitment to inclusive design but also increased my ability to contribute meaningfully to accessibility initiatives across digital platforms.
