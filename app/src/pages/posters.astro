        <h2>Insights from our Web Analytics</h2>
        <p> 
           Austin Deneau, Shelby Kroske, and I presented a poster at the MSU Libraries Knowledge and Creativity Exchange, offering a preview of the quantitative data behind the usage of the main library website. The poster (Figure 1) showcased key statistics such as the most frequently visited pages, top search terms,  browser usage, mobile usage, and other key usage metrics. During our poster presentation, we discussed how this data is being used to guide our decision-making processâ€”helping us refine features, prioritize improvements, and better understand user behavior.
