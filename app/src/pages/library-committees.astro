            <h2>Library Environmental Committee</h2>
            <p>
                Over the past two years, I have had the privilege of serving as Co-Chair of the Library Environmental Committee, a role that has been both professionally enriching and personally meaningful. In collaboration with Leah Morin, I led several key sustainability initiatives aimed at fostering environmental awareness and engagement within our library and the broader campus community. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Highlights of our work include organizing a series of impactful events for Earth Day 2025 such as collaborating with Jodi Colter for the Maple Syrup Tasting event at the MSU Library (Figure 1), coordinating educational tours of the MSU Recycling Center (Figure 2) and the MSU Organic Farm (Figure 3), and facilitating a collaborative relationship with the Sustainable Spartans student organization. These partnerships not only strengthened our programming but also laid the groundwork for future joint initiatives.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most rewarding aspects of my role was serving as a liaison between the committee and library leadership. I met regularly with the Dean of the Library to communicate our goals, share progress, and advocate for sustainable practices. I’m especially proud of our committee’s support for Eric Tans in pursuing the Sustainable Libraries Initiative Certification—an effort that could position our library as the first in the Big Ten Conference to achieve this distinction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I took the initiative to archive historical committee documents, including meeting minutes and newsletters, to preserve our institutional memory and provide a valuable resource for future members. I also enjoyed contributing to public engagement efforts by introducing guest speakers and supporting Beal Garden tours as an on-the-ground coordinator (Figure 4).
